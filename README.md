# Insurance-Cost-Analysis
Performs data analytics on a medical insurance charges dataset

Objectives
In this project, I will:

- Load the data as a pandas dataframe
- Clean the data, taking care of the blank entries
- Run exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identify the attributes that most affect the charges
- Develop single variable and multi variable Linear Regression models for predicting the charges
- Use Ridge regression to refine the performance of Linear regression models.
